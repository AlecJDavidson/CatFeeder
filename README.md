# CatFeeder
This is the code that I used to drive my automatic cat feeder.

This is a project that I made so that I wouldn't have to feed the cats manually anymore. You can use a raspberry pi and crontab to run the feed script whenever it's time for your cats to be fed.

You can run the feed script with "python3 feed.py"
